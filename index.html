            <p>Hello World! My name is Joseph Jimenez and I am from Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Do you know that Tegucigalpa is also known as Distrito Central? Is really interesting! Tegucigalpa's name meaning comes from the indigenous language nahuatl, Tegucigalpa in spanish is: Cerro de Plata (Hill of silver) or Colinas Plateadas (Silver hills), which is derivated from the nahualt words: tecuani (which means tiger), ci (which means place), and calli (which means home or place). Also, did you know that Tegucigalpa wasn't originally Honduras capital? The first capital in the history of our country was under the name of Trujillo, then it was moved to Comayagua, Comayagua in 1537 to 1880, then to Gracias, Lempira in 1880 to 1891, then to Santa Rosa de Copan, Copan in 1840 to 1842, then to Amapala, Isla del Tigre in 1843 to 1844, then to Cedros in 1844 to 1845 and at the end was moved to Tegucigalpa from 1891 until today 2024. Also a fun fact is that many people believe that the captial change that the president of that time fell in love with a woman that lived in Tegucigalpa, but he lived in Comayagua, then he choosed to move the capital from Comayagua to Tegucigalpa to be closer to her.</p>
