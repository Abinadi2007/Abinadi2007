            <p>Hello World! My name is Joseph Jimenez and I am from Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Do you know that Tegucigalpa is also known as Distrito Central? It's really interesting! Tegucigalpa's name meaning comes from the indigenous language Nahuatl. In Spanish, Tegucigalpa is translated as Cerro de Plata (Hill of Silver) or Colinas Plateadas (Silver Hills), which is derived from the Nahuatl words: tecuani (which means tiger), ci (which means place), and calli (which means home or place). Also, did you know that Tegucigalpa wasn't originally Honduras' capital? The first capital in the history of our country was under the name of Trujillo, then it was moved to Comayagua, Comayagua from 1537 to 1880, then to Gracias, Lempira from 1880 to 1891, then to Santa Rosa de Copan, Copan from 1840 to 1842, then to Amapala, Isla del Tigre from 1843 to 1844, then to Cedros from 1844 to 1845, and finally, it was moved to Tegucigalpa in 1891 where it remains today. A fun fact is that many people believe that the capital change occurred because the president of that time fell in love with a woman who lived in Tegucigalpa, but he lived in Comayagua. Consequently, he chose to move the capital from Comayagua to Tegucigalpa to be closer to her.</p>

            <p>Francisco Morazan is one of the 18 departments that builds the Republic of Honduras. Francisco Morazan department (state) is named after the liberalist general who led the formation of the Federal Republic of Central America and was executed by firing squad in Costa Rica, San Jose. Francisco Morazan department was originally named Tegucigalpa which was formed by the first president of Honduras, Dionisio de Herrera, on June 25, 1825, but in 1869 was renamed under Francisco Morazan's name after Texiguat municipality annexed to El Paraiso department. The first temple for Honduras was announced to be built in Tegucigalpa, Francisco Morazan on June 9, 2006, and dedicated on March 17, 2013, blessing the entire country.</p>
